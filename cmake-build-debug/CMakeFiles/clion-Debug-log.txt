CMake Warning (dev) at /Applications/CLion.app/Contents/bin/cmake/mac/aarch64/share/cmake-4.0/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:430 (message):
  The package name passed to find_package_handle_standard_args() (Freetype)
  does not match the name of the calling package (freetype).  This can lead
  to problems in calling code that expects find_package() result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /Applications/CLion.app/Contents/bin/cmake/mac/aarch64/share/cmake-4.0/Modules/Findfreetype.cmake:165 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Deprecation Warning at cmake-build-debug/_deps/cglm-src/CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
  to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
  to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.
